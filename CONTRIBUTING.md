# Contributing to MDX Editor

First things first, if you're doing something in the space, [contact me over the email in my profile](https://github.com/petyosi/). 
The project is still in its infancy, and I would love to get additional perspective.

Bundling is done with Vite, and tests are using Vitest. Ladle is used for examples.

To preview the available examples in the browser, run `pnpm dev`.
