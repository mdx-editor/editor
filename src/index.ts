/**
 * The `@mdxeditor/editor` package exports the MDXEditor React component and a set of plugins and
 * pre-made components for  editing/editor UI.
 *
 * The API Reference is organized around the various features of the editor. Usually, each feature is implemented as a plugin.
 *
 * Several note-worthy types of exports are available:
 *
 * **dollar-suffixed variables** (e.g. `markdown$`, `applyBlockType$`, etc.). These are [reactive Gurx primitives (Cells and Signals)](https://mdx-editor.github.io/gurx/)
 * which let you interact with the editor state and extend it with your own custom logic.
 *
 * The MDXEditor package re-exports Gurx's React hooks, so you can use them like this for example:
 * ```tsx
 * // use the markdown$ cell to get the current markdown value,
 * // and the rootEditor$ cell to get the Lexical editor instance.
 * const [markdown, rootEditor] = useCellValues([markdown$, rootEditor$])
 * // use the applyBlockType$ signal to apply a block type to the current selection
 * const applyBlockType = usePublisher(applyBlockType$)
 * ```
 *
 * **dollar-prefixed functions** (e.g. `$isCodeBlockNode`, etc.). These are following the conventions of the Lexical API, and are usually usable within the Lexical editor read/update cycles.
 *
 * **`plugin` functions** - these are functions that return a plugin object that can be passed to the `plugins` prop of the MDXEditor component. They usually accept a set of configuration options specific to the features they provide.
 *
 * **MDAST Nodes, Lexical Nodes and Import/Export visitors** - these are part of the bi-directional Markdown to/from Lexical state conversion API.
 *
 * **Toolbar plugins and primitives** - React components that can be used in the Editor toolbar. The primitives are meant to be used to build your own toolbar items.
